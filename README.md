This project contains the original code from my master's thesis, where I conducted a quantitative analysis of traditional and modern poetry from the 20th century. Utilizing text analysis methods such as topic modeling and sentiment analysis, I explored the evolution of modernist poetics during this period. The analysis reveals that the shifts in modernist poetic principles are not only perceptible through traditional close reading but also measurable through quantifiable data. This project demonstrates how computational approaches can provide new insights into the transformation of poetic form and content across time.
