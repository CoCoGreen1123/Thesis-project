EROS AND PSYCHE


  In an old dull yard near Camden Town,
  Which echoes with the rattle of cars and 'busses
  And freight-trains, puffing steam and smoke and dirt
  To the steaming, sooty sky--
  There stands an old and grimy statue,
  A statue of Psyche and her lover, Eros.

  A little nearer Camden Town,
  In a square of ugly sordid shops,
  Is another statue, facing the Tube,
  Staring with a heavy, purposeless glare
  At the red and white shining tiles--
  A tall stone statue of Cobden.
  And though no one ever pauses to see
  What hero it is that faces the Tube,
  I can understand very well indeed
  That England must honour its national heroes,
  Must honour the hero of Free Trade--
  Or was it the Corn Laws?--
  That I can understand.
  But what I shall never understand
  Is the little group in the dingy yard
  Under the dingier sky,
  The Eros and Psyche--
  Surrounded with pots and terra-cotta busts
  And urns and broken pillars--
  Eros, naked, with his wings stretched out
  Just lighting down to kiss her on the lips.

  What are they doing here in Camden Town
  In the midst of all this clamour and filth?
  They who should stand in a sun-lit room
  Hung with deep purple, painted with gods,
  Paved with white porphyry,
  Stand for ever embraced
  By the side of a rustling fountain
  Over a marble basin
  Carved with leopards and grapes and young men dancing;
  Or in a garden leaning above Corinth,
  Under the ilices and the cypresses,
  Very white against a very blue sky;
  Or growing hoary, if they must grow old,
  With lichens and softly creeping moss.
  What are they doing here in Camden Town?
  And who has brought their naked beauty
  And their young fresh lust to Camden Town,
  Which settled long ago to toil and sweat and filth,
  Forgetting--to the greater glory of Free Trade--
  Young beauty and young love and youthful flesh?

  Slowly the rain settles down on them,
  Slowly the soot eats into them,
  Slowly the stone grows greyer and dirtier,
  Till in spite of his spreading wings
  Her eyes have a rim of soot
  Half an inch deep,
  And his wings, the tall god's wings,
  That should be red and silver
  Are ocherous brown.

  And I peer from a 'bus-top
  As we splash through the grease and puddles,
  And I glimpse them, huddled against the wall,
  Half-hidden under a freight-train's smoke,
  And I see the limbs that a Greek slave cut
  In some old Italian town,
  I see them growing older
  And sadder
  And greyer.




AFTER TWO YEARS


  She is all so slight
  And tender and white
      As a May morning.
  She walks without hood
  At dusk. It is good
      To hear her sing.

  It is God's will
  That I shall love her still
      As He loves Mary.
  And night and day
  I will go forth to pray
      That she love me.

  She is as gold
  Lovely, and far more cold.
      Do thou pray with me,
  For if I win grace
  To kiss twice her face
      God has done well to me.




1915


  The limbs of gods,
  Still, veined marble,
  Rest heavily in sleep
  Under a saffron twilight.

  Not for them battle,
  Severed limbs, death, and a cry of victory;
  Not for them strife
  And a torment of storm.

  A vast breast moves slowly,
  The great thighs shift,
  The stone eyelids rise;
  The slow tongue speaks:

  "_Only a rain of bright dust;_
  _In the outer air;_
  _A little whisper of wind;_
  _Sleep; rest; forget._"

  Bright dust of battle!
  A little whisper of dead souls!




WHITECHAPEL


  Noise;
  Iron hoofs, iron wheels, iron din
  Of drays and trams and feet passing;
  Iron
  Beaten to a vast mad cacophony.

  _In vain the shrill, far cry_
  _Of swallows sweeping by;_
  _In vain the silence and green_
  _Of meadows Apriline;_
  _In vain the clear white rain--_

  Soot; mud;
  A nation maddened with labour;
  Interminable collision of energies--
  Iron beating upon iron;
  Smoke whirling upwards,
  Speechless, impotent.

  _In vain the shrill, far cry_
  _Of kittiwakes that fly_
  _Where the sea waves leap green._
  _The meadows Apriline--_

  Noise, iron, smoke;
  Iron, iron, iron.




SUNSETS


  The white body of the evening
  Is torn into scarlet,
  Slashed and gouged and seared
  Into crimson,
  And hung ironically
  With garlands of mist.

  And the wind
  Blowing over London from Flanders
  Has a bitter taste.




PEOPLE


  Why should you try to crush me?
  Am I so Christ-like?

  You beat against me,
  Immense waves, filthy with refuse.
  I am the last upright of a smashed break-water,
  But you shall not crush me
  Though you bury me in foaming slime
  And hiss your hatred about me.

  You break over me, cover me;
  I shudder at the contact;
  Yet I pierce through you
  And stand up, torn, dripping, shaken,
  But whole and fierce.




REFLECTIONS


I

  Steal out with me
  Over the moss and the daffodils.

  Come to the temple,
  Hung with sprays from untrimmed hedges.

  I bring you a token
  From the golden-haired revellers,
  From the mad procession.

  Come,
  Flute girls shall pipe to us--
  Their beautiful fingers!--
  They are yellow-throated birds.
  They send perfumes from dawn-scented garments,
  Bending above us.

  Come,
  Bind your hair with white poplar,
  Let your lips be sweet,
  Wild roses of Paestum.


II

  Ghost moths hover over asphodel;
  Shades, once La√Øs' peers
  Drift past us;
  The mist is grey.

  Far over us
  The white wave-crests flash in the sun;
  The sea-girls lie upon hot, weedy rocks.

  Now the Maid returns to us
  With fragrance of the world
  And of the hours of gods.
  On earth
  Apple-trees, weighted with red fruit,
  Streams, passing through the corn lands,
  Hear laughter.

  We pluck the asphodel,
  Yet we weave no crowns
  For we have no vines;
  No one speaks here;
  No one kisses.

VCHILDHOOD

                          I

  The bitterness, the misery, the wretchedness of childhood
  Put me out of love with God.
  I can't believe in God's goodness;
  I can believe
  In many avenging gods.
  Most of all I believe
  In gods of bitter dullness,
  Cruel local gods
  Who seared my childhood.

                          II

  I've seen people put
  A chrysalis in a match-box,
  "To see," they told me, "what sort of moth would come."
  But when it broke its shell
  It slipped and stumbled and fell about its prison
  And tried to climb to the light
  For space to dry its wings.

  That's how I was.
  Somebody found my chrysalis
  And shut it in a match-box.
  My shrivelled wings were beaten,
  Shed their colours in dusty scales
  Before the box was opened
  For the moth to fly.

  And then it was too late,
  Because the beauty a child has,
  And the beautiful things it learns before its birth,
  Were shed, like moth-scales, from me.

                          III

  I hate that town;
  I hate the town I lived in when I was little;
  I hate to think of it.
  There were always clouds, smoke, rain
  In that dingy little valley.
  It rained; it always rained.
  I think I never saw the sun until I was nine--
  And then it was too late;
  Everything's too late after the first seven years.

  That long street we lived in
  Was duller than a drain
  And nearly as dingy.
  There were the big College
  And the pseudo-Gothic town-hall.
  There were the sordid provincial shops--
  The grocer's, and the shops for women,
  The shop where I bought transfers,
  And the piano and gramaphone shop
  Where I used to stand
  Staring at the huge shiny pianos and at the pictures
  Of a white dog looking into a gramaphone.

  How dull and greasy and grey and sordid it was!
  On wet days--it was always wet--
  I used to kneel on a chair
  And look at it from the window.

  The dirty yellow trams
  Dragged noisily along
  With a clatter of wheels and bells
  And a humming of wires overhead.
  They threw up the filthy rain-water from the hollow lines
  And then the water ran back
  Full of brownish foam bubbles.

  There was nothing else to see--
  It was all so dull--
  Except a few grey legs under shiny black umbrellas
  Running along the grey shiny pavements;
  Sometimes there was a waggon
  Whose horses made a strange loud hollow sound
  With their hoofs
  Through the silent rain.

  And there was a grey museum
  Full of dead birds and dead insects and dead animals
  And a few relics of the Romans--dead also.
  There was the sea-front,
  A long asphalt walk with a bleak road beside it,
  Three piers, a row of houses,
  And a salt dirty smell from the little harbour.

  I was like a moth---
  Like one of those grey Emperor moths
  Which flutter through the vines at Capri.
  And that damned little town was my match-box,
  Against whose sides I beat and beat
  Until my wings were torn and faded, and dingy
  As that damned little town.

                          IV

  At school it was just dull as that dull High Street.
  They taught me pothooks--
  I wanted to be alone, although I was so little,
  Alone, away from the rain, the dingyness, the dullness,
  Away somewhere else--

  The town was dull;
  The front was dull;
  The High Street and the other street were dull--
  And there was a public park, I remember,
  And that was damned dull too,
  With its beds of geraniums no one was allowed to pick,
  And its clipped lawns you weren't allowed to walk on,
  And the gold-fish pond you mustn't paddle in,
  And the gate made out of a whale's jaw-bones,
  And the swings, which were for "Board-School children,"
  And its gravel paths.

  And on Sundays they rang the bells,
  From Baptist and Evangelical and Catholic churches.
  They had the Salvation Army.
  I was taken to a High Church;
  The parson's name was Mowbray,
  "Which is a good name but he thinks too much of it--"
  That's what I heard people say.

  I took a little black book
  To that cold, grey, damp, smelling church,
  And I had to sit on a hard bench,
  Wriggle off it to kneel down when they sang psalms,
  And wriggle off it to kneel down when they prayed--
  And then there was nothing to do
  Except to play trains with the hymn-books.

  There was nothing to see,
  Nothing to do,
  Nothing to play with,
  Except that in an empty room upstairs
  There was a large tin box
  Containing reproductions of the Magna Charta,
  Of the Declaration of Independence
  And of a letter from Raleigh after the Armada.
  There were also several packets of stamps,
  Yellow and blue Guatemala parrots,
  Blue stags and red baboons and birds from Sarawak,
  Indians and Men-of-war
  From the United States,
  And the green and red portraits
  Of King Francobollo
  Of Italy.

                          V

  I don't believe in God.
  I do believe in avenging gods
  Who plague us for sins we never sinned
  But who avenge us.

  That's why I'll never have a child,
  Never shut up a chrysalis in a match-box
  For the moth to spoil and crush its bright colours,
  Beating its wings against the dingy prison-wall.


THE POPLAR

  Why do you always stand there shivering
  Between the white stream and the road?

  The people pass through the dust
  On bicycles, in carts, in motor-cars;
  The waggoners go by at dawn;
  The lovers walk on the grass path at night.

  Stir from your roots, walk, poplar!
  You are more beautiful than they are.

  I know that the white wind loves you,
  Is always kissing you and turning up
  The white lining of your green petticoat.
  The sky darts through you like blue rain,
  And the grey rain drips on your flanks
  And loves you.
  And I have seen the moon
  Slip his silver penny into your pocket
  As you straightened your hair;
  And the white mist curling and hesitating
  Like a bashful lover about your knees.

  I know you, poplar;
  I have watched you since I was ten.
  But if you had a little real love,
  A little strength,
  You would leave your nonchalant idle lovers
  And go walking down the white road
  Behind the waggoners.

  There are beautiful beeches down beyond the hill.
  Will you always stand there shivering?


ROUND-POND

  Water ruffled and speckled by galloping wind
  Which puffs and spurts it into tiny pashing breakers
  Dashed with lemon-yellow afternoon sunlight.
  The shining of the sun upon the water
  Is like a scattering of gold crocus-petals
  In a long wavering irregular flight.

  The water is cold to the eye
  As the wind to the cheek.

  In the budding chestnuts
  Whose sticky buds glimmer and are half-burst open
  The starlings make their clitter-clatter;
  And the blackbirds in the grass
  Are getting as fat as the pigeons.

  Too-hoo, this is brave;
  Even the cold wind is seeking a new mistress.


DAISY

  "_Plus quam se atque suos amavit omnes,
  Nunc_..."

                                CATULLUS.

  You were my playmate by the sea.
  We swam together.
  Your girl's body had no breasts.

  We found prawns among the rocks;
  We liked to feel the sun and to do nothing;
  In the evening we played games with the others.

  It made me glad to be by you.

  Sometimes I kissed you,
  And you were always glad to kiss me;
  But I was afraid--I was only fourteen.

  And I had quite forgotten you,
  You and your name.

  To-day I pass through the streets.
  She who touches my arm and talks with me
  Is--who knows?--Helen of Sparta,
  Dryope, Laodamia....

  And there are you
  A whore in Oxford Street.


EPIGRAMS

            A GIRL

  You were that clear Sicilian fluting
  That pains our thought even now.
  You were the notes
  Of cold fantastic grief
  Some few found beautiful.

            NEW LOVE

  She has new leaves
  After her dead flowers,
  Like the little almond-tree
  Which the frost hurt.

            OCTOBER

  The beech-leaves are silver
  For lack of the tree's blood.

  At your kiss my lips
  Become like the autumn beech-leaves.


THE FAUN SEES SNOW FOR THE FIRST TIME

  Zeus,
  Brazen-thunder-hurler,
  Cloud-whirler, son-of-Kronos,
  Send vengeance on these Oreads
  Who strew
  White frozen flecks of mist and cloud
  Over the brown trees and the tufted grass
  Of the meadows, where the stream
  Runs black through shining banks
  Of bluish white.

  Zeus,
  Are the halls of heaven broken up
  That you flake down upon me
  Feather-strips of marble?

  Dis and Styx!
  When I stamp my hoof
  The frozen-cloud-specks jam into the cleft
  So that I reel upon two slippery points....

  Fool, to stand here cursing
  When I might be running!


LEMURES

  In Nineveh
  And beyond Nineveh
  In the dusk
  They were afraid.

  In Thebes of Egypt
  In the dusk
  They chanted of them to the dead.

  In my Lesbos and Achaia
  Where the God dwelt
  We knew them.

  Now men say "They are not":
  But in the dusk
  Ere the white sun comes--
  A gay child that bears a white candle--
  I am afraid of their rustling,
  Of their terrible silence,
  The menace of their secrecy.
