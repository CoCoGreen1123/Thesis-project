Wild Songs
(From “Monoliths”)

Skipwith Cannell

IN THE FOREST
I am not alone, for there are eyes

Stealthy and curious,

And they turn to me.

I will shout loudly to the forest,

I will shout and with a sob

Griping my throat I will cower

Quickly

Beneath my cloak.

For the old gods stand silently

Behind the silent trees,

And when I shout they step forth

And I dare not

Look upon their faces.

THE FLOOD TIDE
The red in me

Lives too near my throat.

My heart is choked with blood,

And a rage drives it upward

As the moon drags the flood tide

Raging

Across the marshes.

I will dance

Somberly,

In a ritual

Terrible and soothing;

I will dance that I may not

Tear out his throat

In murder.

THE DANCE
With wide flung arms,

With feet clinging to the earth

I will dance.

My breath sobs in my belly

For an old sorrow that has put out the sun,

An old, furious sorrow ...

I will grin,

I will bare my gums and grin

Like a grey wolf who has come upon a bear.
