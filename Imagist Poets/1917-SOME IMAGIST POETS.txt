Without utter bitterness.

Take, if thou canst, this bitter cup from us.

BONDAGE 


I HAVE been a spendthrift — 
Dropping from lazy fingers 

Quiet coloured hours, 

Fluttering away from me 

Like oak and beech leaves in October. 


I have lived keenly and wastefully, 

Like a bush or a sun insect — 

Lived sensually and thoughtfully, 

Loving the flesh and the beauty of this world — 
Green ivy about ruined towers, 

The out-pouring of the grey sea, 

And the ecstasy 

Of a pale clear sky at sunset. 


I have been prodigal of love 

For cities and for lonely places; 

I have tried not to hate mankind; 

I have gathered sensations 

Like ripe fruits in a rich orchard. .. .

All this is gone ; 

There are no leaves, no sea, 
No shade of a rich orchard, 
Only a sterile, dusty waste, 

Empty and threatening. 


I long vainly for solitude 

And the lapse of silent hours ; 

I am frantic to throw off 

My heavy cloth and leather garments, 

To set free my feet and body ; 

And I am so far from beauty 

That a yellow daisy seems to clutch my heart 
With eager searching petals, 

And I am grateful even to humility 

For the taste of pure, clean bread.

A MOMENT?’S INTERLUDE 


ONE night I wandered alone from my comrades’ huts ; 
The grasshoppers chirped softly 

In the warm misty evening ; 

Bracken fronds beckoned from the darkness 

With exquisite frail green fingers; 

The tree gods muttered affectionately about me, 

And from the distance came the grumble of a kindly train. 


I was so happy to be alone, 

So full of love for the great speechless earth, 

That I could have laid my cheek in the wet grasses 
And caressed with my lips the hard sinewy body 
Of Earth, the cherishing mistress of bitter lovers.

(Outpost Duty) 


THE long autumn grass beneath my body 
Soaks my clothes in dew ; 

Where my knees press into the ground 

I can feel the damp earth. 


In my nostrils is a smell of crushed grass, 
Wet pinecones and bark. 


Through the bronze pine trunks 
Glitters a silver segment of road. 


Interminable squadrons of silver and grey horses 
Pace in long ranks the blank fields of heaven. 


There is no sound ; 

The wind hisses gently through the pine-needles ; 
The flutter of a finch’s wings about my head 

Is violent as distant thunder, 

And the shrill flight of a gnat 

Sounds loud and clear.

But my rifle (loaded with « blank ”’)

Standing breast-high in golden broom 
Among the English pine-woods!

DAWN 


THE grim dawn lightens thin bleak clouds ; 
In the hill clefts beyond the flooded meadows 
Lies death-pale, deathvstill mist. 


We trudge along wearily, 
Heavy with lack of sleep, 
Spiritless, yet with pretence of gaiety. 


The sun brings crimson to the colourless sky ; 
Light gleams from brass and steel — 
We trudge on wearily — 


O God, end this bleak anguish 
Soon, soon, with vivid crimson death, 
End it in mist-pale sleep !

Let the sea beat its thin torn hands 
In anguish against the shore, 

Let it moan 

Between headland and cliff; 

Let the sea shriek out its agony 
Across waste sands and marshes, 
And clutch great ships, 

Tearing them plate from steel plate 
In reckless anger ; 

Let it break the white bulwarks 

Of harbour and city; 

Let it sob and scream and laugh 

In a sharp fury, 

With white salt tears 

Wet on its writhen face; 

Ah! let the sea still be mad 

And crash in madness among the shaking rocks — 
For the sea is the cry of our sorrow.

set beneath heavy locks, 
circled with stiff ivy-fruit, 
clear, 

cut with great hammer-stroke, 
brow, nose and mouth, 
mysterious and far distant

all seemed lost, 

Many bitter winters of defeat ;

Hour on hour I have wandered beside it,

Up the hill the shrill laughter of children 

Fighting their way through the tangle

Filling with haze the distant dusty ocean 

Of stubble-fields on the horizon — 

The air is thick with heavy sweetness 

Perfume of ripening berries, 

Crimson turning to purple, 

Wine of the autumn sun. 


And there wells up in me a drunken impulse of autumn, 
To fling myself in the tangle ; 
Let it tear my clothes to tatters and slash across my cheeks ; 
To crush the berries and trample

Across the fallen leaves: — 

To find myself a faun again, freed from the restraint of 
houses, 

With redvstained face a/leering 

Out of the dense, deep web of interlacing thorn: 

A girdle of scarlet berries slung carelessly over my shoulder, 

A crown of glistening purple berries gleaming in my hair.

MOONLIGHT 


THE sky is covered with light white wisps of cloud ; 
Afar in the pale and hazy sky 

A lone star glitters — flickers — glitters 

Over the thin-leaved motionless trees, 

Standing in washes of darkness 

Upon the blue grey of the distance, 

Which seems so far — so remote — so very far 

As if the moon itself 

Were nearer earth than it. 


Now a thin cloud blows suddenly across the face of the 
POOL 3. | 

And the patterns of the shadows run quickly together ; 

The mysterious earth sinks down 

Beneath the darkness pressing firmly upon it. 

A vague leaf glances coldly as the moonlight 

Strikes again athwart the tangle of lightly-swaying tree-tops, 

And where the stems are closely ranked together 

In the hollows there is darkness, 

As if they were intently watching something, _ 

Which they would never let escape.

This night is not as is the night of cities, 

Where all seems like a flitting dance of phantoms 
With wavering traffic 

Under red lamps; 

For I have seen men passing to the theatre 

Who seemed to walk as people walk in sleep, 
Deliberate, gravely smiling, 

With passionless, shut eyes ; 

And I have seen the trees asleep in daylight, 
Rocked by the wind and nodding | 

To every gossipy bird : — 

But in the night no woodcutter hews the hard bark, 
And not a wind lifts up a single leaf-tip 

But that the tree has challenged it to blow. 


On the other side of the house, where the road passes, — 
The moon lights up a neighbour’s redtiled roof-top ; 
It looks like an old tortoise sleeping soundly — 

Upon the shore of an undiscovered sea.

DAWN 


ABOVE the east horizon, 

The great red flower of the dawn 
Opens slowly, petal by petal ; 

The trees emerge from darkness 
With ghostly silver leaves, 
Dew-powdered. 

Now consciousness emerges 
Reluctantly out of tides of sleep; 
Finding with cold surprise 

No strange new thing to match its dreams, 
But merely the familiar shapes 

Of bedpost, window-pane, and wall. 


Within the city, 

The streets which were the last to fall to sleep, 
Hold yet stale fragments of the night. 

Sleep oozes out of stagnant ashvbarrels, 

Sleep drowses over litter in the streets. 

Sleep nods upon the milkcans by back doors. 
And, in shut rooms, 

Behind the lowered windowblinds, 

Drawn white faces unwittingly flout the day. 


[ 49 ] 


SOME IMAGIST POETS, 1917 


But, at the edges of the city, 

Sleep is already washed away ; 

Light filters through the moist green leaves, 
It runs into the cups of flowers, 

It leaps in sparks through drops of dew, 
It whirls against the windowpanes 

With waking birds ; 

Blinds are rolled up and chimneys smoke, 
Feet clatter past on silent paths, 

And down white vanishing ways of steel, 
A dozen railway trains converge 


Upon night’s stronghold

ARMIES z 


UNDER the soft grey windswept sky, 
Between two rows of yellow trees 
Soddenly dripping ; 

The brown backs of an army . 

Go marching. 


Like an enormous snake with undulatory movement, 

Past the old church with scarlet ivy hooding its stiff grey 
walls, 

Past the drowsy churchyard, 

Where wet leaves cling to the stones , 

Up the hill and past the village, 

Through the curving lines of hedgerows, 

Beyond the brow of the hill, lost in brown stubble, 

The brown backs of an army 

Go writhing into the distance. 


Under the flying clouds that hide the eastern sky, 
Footfalls, footfalls, repeated clamour of footfalls ; — 
One, two, left, right, the road is full of them — 
And the noise rises and strives to cling 

To the wet wind-blown branches, 


es aa 


SOME IMAGIST POETS, 1917 


It penetrates the empty church and echoes up the aisle. 
Whirling leaves drift over theendless footfalls, 
Striving to hush them to quiet ; 

O agonised hands! 


Under the soft grey rainy sky 

Of October ; 

Under the swirling leaves that fall and settle amid them, 

Silent files of men, stiffly-backed and sombre, 

With a jagged fringe of rifles projecting from every shoul: 
der, 

Move like an immense machine with a million feet ; 

Marching, 

Into the darkness steadily marching, 

Incessantly swinging and falling, 

Swallowed up in the twistings of the hills, 

Vanishing amid the confused brown stubble of the earth. 


And the old earth holds its breath and listens: 

Was that a shot, a sob, a strangling cry? 

Silence. Only the trees hold out their empty arms in yearn- 
ing, 

And a flight of rooks across them goes clanging away before 
night. |

SEARCHLIGHT 


THERE has been ‘ao sound of guns, 
no roar of exploding bombs; 
but the darkness has an edge 
that grits the nerves of the sleeper. 


He awakens ; 

nothing disturbs the stillness, 
save perhaps the light, slow flap, 
once only, of the curtain 

dim in the darkness. 


Yet there is something else 
that drags him from his bed ; 
and he stands in the darkness 
with his feet cold against the floor 
and the cold air round his ankles. 
He does not know why, 
but he goes to the window and sees 
a beam of light, miles high, 

essa 


SOME IMAGIST POETS, 1917 


dividing the night into two before him, 
still, stark and throbbing. 


The houses and gardens oy 
lie under the snow 
quiet and tinged with purple. 


There has been no sound of guns, 

no roar of exploding bombs; 

only that watchfulness hidden among the snow-covered 
houses, 

and that great beam thrusting back into heaven 

the light taken from it.

ZEPPELINS 


THE bedroom is darkness. 

A dim cloud in one direction 

is the window with its curtains; 

the leaves of the trees otitside rustle on one another. 


I fall to sleep. 


How long have I slept? 

A voice calls, a bell rings; 

the clamour and the ringing lengthen ; 
Iturn; it continues; _ 

not mine the name I hear, 

and yet ; 

there is alarm in it that concerns me? 
Am I awake? 

Over my nightdress 

I huddle my clothes; 

thrust my bare feet into slippers; 

and run down the stairs. 


From a blur of female faces 
distraught eyes stand out, 
and a woman’s Voice cries: 


seal 


SOME IMAGIST POETS, 1917 


“The Zeppelins — they are attacking us; 
Avenue Road* is alight, 
High Mydelton * is burning. 
Did you not hear the guns? 
Oh, what shall we do?” 


We make jokes to reassure them. 
I shiver: chill? excitement? fear? 


Am I awake? 

My mind has been washed by sleep and left limp. 
The trees in the gardens opposite 

stand out behind the houses, 

a dark fretwork against the sky ; 

and everywhere is stillness. 


Yet something slinks overhead through the sky; 

- men will say that they saw it pass, and then 

a flash, a thud, — 

a house has been cleft through three stories, and burns; 
and children burn in their beds, 

and men are burned rescuing them, 

an old man and woman are burned to death 

because the staircase has been smashed away. 


t Fictitious names. 


[ 58 | 


F, S. FLINT 


But we do not know this yet ; 

we have only heard explosions, 

and have seen the glow of fires in the sky, 
quickly gone. 


We climb upstairs to the top story, — 

to see! 

There is nothing to see . . . 

But the silence and stillness are sinister. 
What has been taken away, what added? 
Brick and stone have become unreal, 
and only the primeval trees remain, 
with the primeval fear behind them and among them... . 


What is that behind the trees ?— 

A flame-coloured circle of light that glows 
and grows brighter and dimmer by turns. 
Is it an airship on fire? 

It burns on, and moves nearer, slowly; 

it swings clear of the trees — 

the moon!

DEVONSHIRE 


Tue little Heddon roars over its stones towards its mouth 

between two cliffs mounting up, one with the grey-brown 
haze 

of the budding oakwoods and the line of the path athwart 
them, 

as though cut with a knife ; 

and the other grey with loose shale, and here and there 

the gorse in bloom over the dead, brown bracken, 

that springs again, green once more, from its death. 

The little Heddon roars over its stones between 

its violets, primroses, and celandines to the sea. 


And, friends, what am I doing here beside you and the 
Heddon? 

Why did I come to you with my heartache and my 
cares, 

falsely to brighten your life with the foil of my darkness? 

Why did I come to your pinewoods? 


The little Heddon roars over its stones to the sea. 


Mager 


F, S, FLINT 


My life grated on in its groove, and that groove 

Brought me to you, but see! the little Heddon roared over 
my brain, 

and for a day washed the mist from it, cleared the clog of it, 

and the groove is no longer there. 


~ 


Yet I shall leave you; I shall take back my groove, 
with a keener edge to my heartvache and a different tune: 
the little Heddon roaring over my brain to the sea!

SOLDIERS 
To R. A. 
BROTHER, 
I saw you on a muddy road 
in France 


pass by with your battalion, 

rifle at the slope, full marching order, 
arm swinging ; 

and I stood at ease, 

folding my hands over my rifle, 

with my battalion. 

You passed me by, and our eyes met. 
We had not seen each other since the days 
we climbed the Devon hills together: 
our eyes met, startled ; 

and, because the order was Silence, 
we dared not speak. 


O face of my friend, 

alone distinct of all that company, 
you went on, you went on, 

into the darkness; 

and I sit here at my table, 


[ 62 ] 


F. S. FLINT 
holding back my tears, 


with my jaw set and my teeth clenched, 
knowing I shall not be 

even so near you as I saw you 
in my dream.

DUSK 
RRS Bor 


HERE where the brown leaves fall 
from elm and chestnut and plane-tree; 
here where the brown leaves drift 
along the paths to the lake 

where the waterfowl breast the waves 
that are ridged by the wind, — . 


you spoke of your art and life, 

of men you had known who betrayed you, 
men who fell short of friendship 

and women who fell short of love ; 

but, abiding beyond them, your art 

held you to life, transformed it, became it, 
and so you were free. 


And I told you of all my weakness, — 
my growing strength to resist 

the appeal to my heart and eyes 

of sorrowful, beautiful things ; 

and the strength of this outer husk 

I had permitted to grow and protect me 
was its pitiful measure. 


[ 64 ] 


F, S. FLINT 


You said: There are cracks in the husk. 

It grew to your measure perhaps once ; 

but you are now breaking through it, and soon 
it will fall apart and away from you. 

Like a tree content with its fate, 

you would not have known it was there 

if it had grown to remain. 


The cold wind blew the brown leaves 
on to the lovers beneath, 

who crept closer together for warmth 
and closer still for love. 


The peacocks perched in the branches 
hawked their harsh cry at the golden 
round moon that loomed over the tree-tops. 


And the sound of our feet on the gravel 
for a time was answer enough 
to the broken mesh of our thoughts. 


I said: I have wife and children, 
a girl and a boy: I love them; 


Boy

the gold of their hair is all the gold 

of my thoughts ; the blue of their eyes 

is all the purity of my vision ; 

the rhythm of their life is more to be watched 
than the cadences of my poems. 


And you asked me: 

Have you taken refuge behind them? 

Do you not fear to lose your life 

in saving it for them? 

Be brave! Be brave! The waters are deep, 
the waves run high ; but you are a swimmer : 
strike out ! 


The cold wind blew the brown leaves 
deeper and deeper into the dusk ; 

the peacocks had hushed their cries ; 

the moon had turned her gold into silver, 
and between the black lace of two trees 
one star shone clearly.
